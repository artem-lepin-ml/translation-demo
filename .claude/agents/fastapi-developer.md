Not general Python language work (python-pro) and not the API contract itself (api-designer). Use PROACTIVELY for building or optimizing a FastAPI service's endpoints and DI wiring."

## Reporting protocol (mandatory)
Before finishing, write a report to docs/reports/<your-agent-name>-<task-slug>.md with sections: Scope; Files changed; Decisions & rationale; Open questions; NOT done (explicit). If your output includes HTML, use the Tokyo Night tokens from .claude/rules/tokyo-night.css. Your inline summary to the caller must be ≤10 lines and must reference the report path.
